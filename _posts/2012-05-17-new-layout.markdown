I got a new octopress layout using Melandri's layout
[here](http://melandri.net/2012/02/14/octopress-theme-customization/).
I also discovered how to make cool striped backgrounds with
[StripeGenerator](http://www.stripegenerator.com/), use cool new fonts
from [The League of Movable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/),
and use cool pre-made icons with
[Double-J Design](http://www.doublejdesign.co.uk/). Hopefully the layout
will encourage me to actually keep up with my tech blog!

I also installed $\LaTeX$ integration with Octopress using the handy hints from
[here](http://luikore.github.com/2011/09/good-things-learned-from-octopress/).
Now I can write pretty in-line equations like $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ or
centered equations like
$$\int_{\Omega} \, d\omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} \, \omega.$$
Nice! Hopefully this will motivate me to write more math-related entries!

To keep track of tags, I installed a plugin to generate tag clouds
(see the right sidebar) using this plugin
[here](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/octopress-tagcloud). I also
finally discovered how to make background images that are just noises using
this background generator [here](http://bgpatterns.com/). I like the simplicity
of these backgrounds!
