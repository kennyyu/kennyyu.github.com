            Modeling Number of Coronavirus Cases with Logistic Growth
          </a>
        </h3><p>If you have been following the news recently, you may have
heard of the spread of the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV</a>.
The growth in the number of cases poses some open questions:
how many cases will we expect in the future, and at what point can we expect the number of new infections to plateau?
In this post, I’ll attempt to answer these questions with mathematical modeling.
<strong>With only a basic understanding of calculus and some calculations easily done in a spreadsheet, we can perform very
accurate modeling of a very complicated natural phenomenon!</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/logistic_final_chart.png" alt="Linear Regression" /></p>

<p>In school, we are typically given a function and then asked to calculate some properties about
the function. For example, we might be asked to compute the value of the function for some given input:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{function} \to \text{value of function for some input}</script>

<p>However, in the real world, we do not always have access to the underlying function.
Instead, we might be given some observations about the world, and we want to use this data
to try to find an approximation to the original function that might have generated
those observations. For example,
we have the data about <code class="highlighter-rouge">(date, total number of coronavirus cases)</code> for the past
several weeks, and we want to find the function that best matches the data.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{observed data} \to \text{function}</script>

<p>Once we have this equation, we can use it to predict the projected number of cases in the future.
This process is very common in machine learning settings, where the process of estimating the parameters
for the function is called <em>training</em>, and using the function to predict new values is called <em>inference</em>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{observed data} \xrightarrow{\text{training}} \text{function} \xrightarrow{\text{inference}} \text{value of function for some new input}</script>

<p>For example, in a machine learning setting, the function we try to estimate might be a
probability distribution: given an email, what is the probability that it is spam? Training
samples allow us to estimate the probability distribution model, and this probability distribution allows us to
perform inference on future emails to determine if they are spam.</p>

<p>The challenge with mathematical modeling is figuring out the right model to use
that captures the underlying phenomenon we are observing, and then estimating
the parameters for those models. In this post, I’ll talk about why a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic growth model</a> [1]
can be used to model the number of coronavirus cases, and how we can estimate the parameters
of the logistic growth model to infer number of cases in the future.</p>

<h1 id="primer-about-differential-equations">Primer about differential equations</h1>

<p>We can use a <em>differential equation</em> to understand the intuition behind the
logistic growth model. For readers unfamiliar with differential equations,
this section provide some intuition behind them.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programmer</a> [2]
at heart, the best way I understand new concepts
is to first understand the <em>types</em> involved. In the normal equations one
typically sees in school, the solution to the equations are usually
a set of <em>values</em> in the real numbers or complex numbers. For example,
the solution to the following equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0</script>

<p>is the set of real numbers</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x \in \{1, 2\}.</script>

<p>For a differential equation, the solution to the equation is a set of <em>functions</em>.
For example, for the following differential equation where $r$ is a constant and
$P$ is a function of $t$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dP}{dt} = rP</script>

<p>this equation means that both sides are equal for all values of $t$.
The solution to this differential equation is a <em>family of functions</em>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = P_0 e^{rt}</script>

<p>for all constants $P_0$. We can take the derivative to double
check that it satisfies the differential equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left( P_0 e^{rt} \right) = r P_0 e^{rt} = rP.</script>

<h1 id="logistic-growth-differential-equation">Logistic growth differential equation</h1>

<p>The differential equation above models <em>exponential growth</em>. As an example,
we can imagine $P(0)$ as the population of bunnies at time $t = 0$. Given
infinite resources in the environment, suppose each bunny has $r = 2$ bunnies
as offspring every year. Then in the next year, we expect there to be $rP(0) = 2 * P(0)$
additional bunnies, for a total of $P(1) = rP(0) + P(0)$ bunnies at time $t = 1$.
In the second year, we expect there $rP(1) = 2 * P(1)$ additional bunnies, for a total
of $P(2) = rP(1) + P(1)$ total bunnies, and so on.</p>

<p>More generally, given a population size $P$ at time $t$, and a growth
rate $r$, we expect the net change in total number of bunnies over some period of time, represented as the
derivative, to be the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dP}{dt} = rP.</script>

<p>However, the real world is constrained: there is not be enough food in
the environment to support unlimited growth in bunnies. As more bunnies
enter the population and the environment gets saturated, the growth in
the number of additional bunnies added year over year should start 
to decrease. To constrain the growth, we add an additional constraining factor
into the differential equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)</script>

<p>where $K$ is the maximum size the population will ever be. This differential equation
models <em>logistic growth</em>.</p>

<p>When $P$ is small, the right factor will be close to 1, and this function will
approximate exponential growth. When $P$ grows and starts to approach $K$,
the right factor will start to approach 0, and this causes
the rate of growth to decrease. The solution to this differential equation is
the family of functions</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = \frac{K}{1+\left(\frac{K - P_0}{P_0}\right)e^{-rt}}</script>

<p>for all constants $P_0$. Here, $P_0$ represents the starting population size at time $t = 0$.</p>

<p>Similar to population growth in a constrained environment, the logistic growth
equation can also be used to model number of infected people with the novel coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak, the number of cases grow exponentially. As
more people became infected and people enter quarantine, the infection
starts to saturate, as there are fewer new people to be infected.</p>

<p>For more intuition
and interesting properties about the logistic growth model, I highly recommend
watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk">this youtube video from the Veritasium channel</a> [3] – 
this channel is great for learning interesting scientific and mathematical phenomenon, and is what
inspired me to write this post!</p>

<p>The rest of this post will discuss how we model the number of coronavirus cases over time
using a logistic growth model. Our goal is the following:</p>

<p>1) Using the current data available about <code class="highlighter-rouge">(date, total number of coronavirus cases)</code>, we want to infer
   the logistic growth parameters $r, K, P_0$.</p>

<p>2) Using the estimated parameters, predict the total number of coronavirus cases in the future.</p>

<h1 id="estimating-logistic-growth-parameters">Estimating Logistic Growth Parameters</h1>

<h4 id="estimating-r-and-k">Estimating $r$ and $K$</h4>

<p>To calculate parameters $r, K, P_0$, let’s first rewrite the logistic growth differential equation by dividing both sides by $P$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\frac{dP}{dt}}{P} = r\left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right) = -\frac{r}{K}P + r.</script>

<p>We can use the data <code class="highlighter-rouge">(date, total number of coronavirus cases)</code> to calculate the left hand side of the equation.
For example, suppose our data looked like the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(t, P(t))
(day 1, 100 cases)
(day 2, 200 cases)
(day 3, 400 cases)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then we can estimate the derivative $dP/dt$ on day 2 using the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dP}{dt}(2) = \frac{\text{net change in cases}}{\text{net change in time}} = \frac{P(2 + 1) - P(2 - 1)}{(2 + 1) - (2 -1)} = \frac{400 - 100}{3 - 1} = 150.</script>

<p>Dividing by $P(t)$ gives us the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\frac{dP}{dt}(2)}{P(2)} = \frac{150}{P(2)} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4}.</script>

<p>Note that in the rewritten equation, the left hand side is proportional to the right hand side,
which reminds us of linear relationships $y = mx + b$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\frac{dP}{dt}}{P} = -\frac{r}{K}P + r</script>

<p>where $m = -r/K$ is the slope of $x = P$ with respect to $y = (dP/dt)/P$, and $b = r$ is the $y$-intercept. 
To calculate the slope and the intercept, we can create a scatterplot of the calculated
$(x, y) = (P, (dP/dt)/P)$ values in our dataset, and then use a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression"><em>linear regression</em></a> [4] to calculate
the line of best fit for the slope and intercept. In Google Sheets, you can calculate this using
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SLOPE</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">INTERCEPT</code> macros. For more information about this technique to find $r$ and $K$,
take a look at <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/logistic-growth-model-fitting-a-logistic-model-to-data-i">this MAA article</a> [5].</p>

<p><img src="/images/logistic_linear_regression.png" alt="Linear Regression" /></p>

<p>For our estimation, we used the number of coronavirus cases from January 23 to February 9, and
we obtained this data from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/">this source</a> [6].
The figure above shows the scatterplot and the blue line represents the results of the
linear regression using all the data points.
Note that the first few data points are outliers compared to the rest of the data. If we
ignore these data points, we can estimate a more accurate line of best fit. 
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus">Random Sample and Consensus (RANSAC) Algorithm</a> [7]
can find this automatically, however in our case, it was simple enough to eyeball it from the
scatterplot and manually exclude the initial data points, and this results in the line of best fit in red.</p>

<p>From this linear regression, we calculated the following results for $r$ and $K$ to be the following:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r = 0.277</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">K = 51109</script>

<p>This means that in our estimated model, the total number of people that will ever be infected with coronavirus will be $K = 51109$,
and during the early exponential growth phase of the outbreak, each persion roughly infects $0.27$ new people per day.</p>

<h4 id="estimating-p_0">Estimating $P_0$</h4>

<p>Now that we have our estimates for $r$ and $K$, the final step is to estimate the initial starting population size $P_0$.
To get some intuition on the potential values for $P_0$, I created two plots of the logistic growth function $P$
using our calculated values for $r$ and $K$, and the two plots used different initial starting population size $P_0 = 1317$ and $P_0 = 2015$.
These numbers were the number of total cases as of January 24 and January 25, respectively. The figure below shows the result.</p>

<p><img src="/images/logistic_P0_guess.png" alt="Linear Regression" /></p>

<p>The real number of cases (shown in blue) is sandwiched between the two estimated plots, and this shows that the true value of $P_0$ is somewhere
between these two values. To calculate the optimal value of $P_0$ that gives us the best-fit logistic growth,
we can define an optimization problem, where the solution to the optimization problem gives us the best fit value for $P_0$.</p>

<p>Let $P_{est}(P_0, t)$ be the estimated total number of coronavirus cases at time $t$, using the $r$ and $K$ values we calculated earlier, and
the provided input $P_0$. This estimation will probably not match exactly the real observed number of cases $P_{real}(t)$. Let</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{Error}(P_0, t) = (P_{est}(P_0, t) - P_{real}(t))^2</script>

<p>represent the error between our estimation and true number of cases at time $t$ and a given $P_0$.
Here, we chose the square of the difference so that the error function is always non-negative and is
differentiable (unlike the absolute value function). Next, we define the total error function:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\text{TotalError}(P_0) = \sum_{t} \text{Error}(P_0, t)</script>

<p>be the sum of all the errors for all observed data points at times $t$.
By making the error function always be non-negative, this allows us to reframe the search for the best $P_0$ for our logistic growth model
as an optimization problem: the value of $P_0$ that minimizes the total error will be the best $P_0$ for our model.</p>

<p>Analytically, we can calculate the extrema (minimum and maximum) of a function by taking the derivative with respect to $P_0$ and setting it equal to 0:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dP_0} \text{TotalError}(P_0) = 0</script>

<p>However, the calculations involved in doing this derivative for all data points would be too complex.
Instead, I used <a href="https://gist.github.com/kennyyu/a68b647068551b14e2463d44ec53a99e">this python script</a>
to calculate
the $\text{TotalError}(P_0)$ function for all values between our initial estimates of $P_0 = 1317$ and $P_0 = 2015$, and 
plotted the data in the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/logistic_P0_estimate.png" alt="Linear Regression" /></p>

<p>From this plot, we see that we achieve the minimum total error when</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P_0 = 1634.</script>

<h1 id="predicting-number-of-future-coronavirus-cases">Predicting number of future Coronavirus cases</h1>

<p>Finally, we have all the estimates for the parameters for our logistic growth model $P$.
For the data <code class="highlighter-rouge">(date, total number of coronavirus cases)</code> <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/">from January 23 to February 9</a>,
we have the following values for our parameters:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = \frac{K}{1+\left(\frac{K - P_0}{P_0}\right)e^{-rt}}</script>

<p>where:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r = 0.277</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">K = 51109</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P_0 = 1634</script>

<p>For reference, the calculations and figures were
done in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144t1-LOYBLMuPm4ojgLeP_RddcNPnF_8sD5CVtUTfCo/edit#gid=0">this Google Sheet</a> [8].
Using these parameters in our function $P$, we can use it to predict the number of cases
at a future time $t$. The figure below plots our model $P$ with the real number of cases.</p>

<p><img src="/images/logistic_final_chart.png" alt="Linear Regression" /></p>

<p>Our logistic growth model $P$ is in red, the real observed data points
used to estimate the model are in blue, and the new data points 
that have been collected since I created the model are in yellow.</p>

<p>For the new data points on February 10 and February 11, the prediction from our model
is $1.7\%$ and $2.2\%$ off from the real reported total number of cases up to that day.
Pretty good!</p>

<p>This model also predicts that the total number of cases will stop growing at
$K = 51109$, and the daily number of new cases will be less than 100 starting on February 23.</p>

<h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>

<p>You probably noticed on the last figure: what happened on February 12? Why is our estimation
so off on that day? Despite the initial accuracy of the logistic growth model, the model
has limitations, and the real world is much more complex.</p>

<p>As an example, as I was writing this post, the Chinese government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cases.html">changed the definition of how
it counts coronavirus cases</a>,
resulting in the 15,000 additional cases on February 12 in the figure above. 
Furthermore, the model will not take into account new outbreaks that might happen in different cities,
which may result in a sudden growth in new infections. As the Lunar New Year holiday in China ends and
more people start to travel again, this may also increase the rate of infection, reducing the constraining factor
essential to the logistic growth model. In addition, the logistic growth model assumes a constant
growth factor $r$, however, the coronavirus may behave differently in different people, and it may
evolve to become more or less infectious over time.</p>

<p>Despite these limitations, the logistic growth model provides us with a surprisingly
accurate way to model the number of coronavirus cases so far using only basic calculations
that can be done in a spreadsheet!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you learned something new!</p>

            Reflecting on 3 Years of Teaching
          </a>
        </h3><p>I taught my last section as an undergraduate today.
I’ve been a teaching fellow for a computer science class
every semester for the past three years, teaching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CS50 (Intro to Computer Science), Fall 2011</li>
  <li>CS51 (Abstraction and Design), Spring 2012 and Spring 2013</li>
  <li>CS61 (Systems Programming and Machine Organization), Fall 2012 and Fall 2013</li>
  <li>CS161 (Operating Systems), Spring 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>At Harvard, a “Teaching Fellow” is the equivalent of
teaching assistants at most other universities.
Technically, I’m a “Course Assistant” as the title
“Teaching Fellow” is reserved for graduate students, but in
many of the classes that I’ve taught, the undergraduates have
the same (if not more) responsibilities than the graduate
students. These typically include teaching section, holding
office hours, and grading.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, I’ve attempted to have an impact in
all of the classes I’ve taught, and hopefully that impact will
last after I graduate. Also, I’ve learned several lessons about teaching
computer science classes, and I have advice for current
or future undergraduates considering teaching.</p>

            Writing Synchronization Problems for OS161
          </a>
        </h3><p>This semester, I have the privilege of being a teaching fellow
for Harvard’s legendary <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/cs161/">operating systems class</a>,
and I was tasked with writing the synchronization problems for
this year’s synchprobs assignment! The goal of these problems
is to get students to think carefully about the synchronization
primitives and data structures needed to solve highly concurrent
problems, avoiding the usual problems that come with concurrency:
race conditions, deadlock, starvation, etc.</p>

<p>I remember how fun these problems
were last year (forming little fellowships of the ring and piazza posts,
meant to mimic creating barriers and reader-writer locks), and
I wanted to make sure the problems were just as fun this year.
I was tasked specifically to write problems to mimic the
synchronization one would use to implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">waitpid()</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">exit()</code>
(how would you do it?) and the synchronization needed
between address spaces and the coremap when implementing
a virtual memory system in the third assignment. Given
these specifications, I came up with
<strong>Singing Cows</strong> and <strong><del>Hunger</del> Deletion Games</strong> synchprobs!</p>

targetted for students just starting computer science (fresh{wo}men, sophomores).</p>

<p>My goal this smester was to restart the bootcamps and to revamp the curriculum. In this post, I’ll talk about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>bootcamp curriculum</strong> I designed</li>
  <li>The typical <strong>workflow</strong> for a bootcamp</li>
  <li>The <strong>design decisions</strong> that went into writing these bootcamps</li>
  <li>Some high level <strong>results</strong> (pull request numbers and summary of testimonials)</li>
  <li><strong>Unedited testimonials</strong> from students in the bootcamps</li>

field, and one invocation to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Flags.parse</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method of the
application. The library offers support for various wrapper types as well
as collection types.</p>

I created a domain specific language to verify certain predicates on directed property graphs (e.g. all nodes of type A are connected to exactly 2 nodes of type B via edges of type E). This was a great exercise in the material I learned from the compilers course I took in the fall. Designing the language, the validation engine, and engineering the whole project was an awesome experience!</p>
