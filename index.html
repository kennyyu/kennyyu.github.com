            Modeling Number of Coronavirus Cases with Logistic Growth

        </h3><p>If you have been following the news recently, you may have
heard of the spread of the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV</a>.
The growth in the number of cases poses some open questions:
how many cases will we expect in the future, and at what point can we expect the number of new infections to plateau?
In this post, I’ll attempt to answer these questions with mathematical modeling.
<strong>With only a basic understanding of calculus and some calculations easily done in a spreadsheet, we can perform very
accurate modeling of a very complicated natural phenomenon!</strong></p>

          </a>
        </h3><p>After taking 18 computer science classes at Harvard (17 in CS, 1 in EE),
I was curious to see exactly how many lines of code I have written
for assignments these past four years. I was also curious what the breakdown
would be for the different programming languages I’ve learned over the years.</p>

<p>After looking through the archives of my computer, I calculated that I wrote
<strong>197,717</strong> lines of code (141,008 insertions, 56,709 deletions) for my
classes in the past four years! In fact, I believe this is actually
an underestimate. In this post, I’ll talk about how
I calculated this number, and assumptions I made when calculating this
number.</p>

            Reflecting on 3 Years of Teaching
          </a>
        </h3><p>I taught my last section as an undergraduate today.
I’ve been a teaching fellow for a computer science class
every semester for the past three years, teaching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CS50 (Intro to Computer Science), Fall 2011</li>
  <li>CS51 (Abstraction and Design), Spring 2012 and Spring 2013</li>
  <li>CS61 (Systems Programming and Machine Organization), Fall 2012 and Fall 2013</li>
  <li>CS161 (Operating Systems), Spring 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>At Harvard, a “Teaching Fellow” is the equivalent of
teaching assistants at most other universities.
Technically, I’m a “Course Assistant” as the title
“Teaching Fellow” is reserved for graduate students, but in
many of the classes that I’ve taught, the undergraduates have
the same (if not more) responsibilities than the graduate
students. These typically include teaching section, holding
office hours, and grading.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, I’ve attempted to have an impact in
all of the classes I’ve taught, and hopefully that impact will
last after I graduate. Also, I’ve learned several lessons about teaching
computer science classes, and I have advice for current
or future undergraduates considering teaching.</p>

            Writing Synchronization Problems for OS161
          </a>
        </h3><p>This semester, I have the privilege of being a teaching fellow
for Harvard’s legendary <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/cs161/">operating systems class</a>,
and I was tasked with writing the synchronization problems for
this year’s synchprobs assignment! The goal of these problems
is to get students to think carefully about the synchronization
primitives and data structures needed to solve highly concurrent
problems, avoiding the usual problems that come with concurrency:
race conditions, deadlock, starvation, etc.</p>

<p>I remember how fun these problems
were last year (forming little fellowships of the ring and piazza posts,
meant to mimic creating barriers and reader-writer locks), and
I wanted to make sure the problems were just as fun this year.
I was tasked specifically to write problems to mimic the
synchronization one would use to implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">waitpid()</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">exit()</code>
(how would you do it?) and the synchronization needed
between address spaces and the coremap when implementing
a virtual memory system in the third assignment. Given
these specifications, I came up with
<strong>Singing Cows</strong> and <strong><del>Hunger</del> Deletion Games</strong> synchprobs!</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>bootcamp curriculum</strong> I designed</li>
  <li>The typical <strong>workflow</strong> for a bootcamp</li>
  <li>The <strong>design decisions</strong> that went into writing these bootcamps</li>

field, and one invocation to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Flags.parse</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">main</code> method of the
application. The library offers support for various wrapper types as well
as collection types.</p>
