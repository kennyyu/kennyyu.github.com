After taking 18 computer science classes at Harvard (17 in CS, 1 in EE),
I was curious to see exactly how many lines of code I have written
for assignments these past four years. I was also curious what the breakdown
would be for the different programming languages I've learned over the years.

After looking through the archives of my computer, I calculated that I wrote
**197,717** lines of code (141,008 insertions, 56,709 deletions) for my
classes in the past four years! In fact, I believe this is actually
an underestimate. In this post, I'll talk about how
I calculated this number, and assumptions I made when calculating this
number.

## Examining my git log

Fortunately, except for freshman year, I used git for all my projects
and assignments. As a result, I can compute the number of lines of code I wrote
by examining by git log history. Using git made calculating my contributions on
group projects especially easy as git keeps track of who authored each commit.
Furthermore, by examining the insertions and deletions of each commit, as opposed to
examining the line count at the HEAD of the branch, I can see a more accurate number
of lines I wrote and deleted, as opposed to the final count at the end of the
assignment/project.

For each git repository, I did the following:

1. Determine which commits were authored by me, using the following command:
   `git log --author=Kenny --oneline`.

2. For each of those commits, examine the insertion/deletion count for that
   commit, broken down for each file: `git show COMMIT --oneline --numstat`

3. Aggregate those stats by file name across all the commits in a repository,
   then aggregate those stats by file type.

4. Do this across all the git repositories for all the courses I took.

If you want to examine your own stats across a repository, you can check
out my [python counting script](https://gist.github.com/kennyyu/5e59519b3972823e20bf).
Here's a snippet of the relevent code performing the steps above.

``` python examining git commits
import subprocess

def command(s):
    """
    Runs the shell command and returns the stdout as a list
    of strings.
    """
    proc = subprocess.Popen(s,
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                            stderr=open(os.devnull, "w"),
                            shell=True)
    # strip trailing newline characters
    lines = proc.stdout.readlines()
    return [l.strip() for l in lines]

def commits_by_author(author):
    """
    Returns the list of commit hashes by the given author
    """
    lines = command("git log --author=\"%s\" --oneline" % author)
    return [l.split(" ")[0] for l in lines]

def commit_stats(commit):
    """
    Returns a mapping of filename -> (additions, deletions)
    """
    lines = command("git show %s --oneline --numstat" % commit)
    assert(len(lines) > 0)

    # the first line is just a repeat of the hash, so skip it
    lines = lines[1:]

    # stats are of the form:
    # additions    deletions    filename
    stats = {}
    for l in lines:
        l = l.strip()
        if l == "":
            continue
        addition, deletion, fname = l.split()
        if addition == "-":
            addition = "0"
        if deletion == "-":
            deletion = "0"
        addition = int(addition)
        deletion = int(deletion)
        stats[fname] = (addition, deletion)
    return stats
```

## Notes

I followed these rules when calculating my total line count.

* **Ignore autogenerated, binary, or raw data files when calculating a line count.**
  When I performed the count on my various git repositories, I noticed that I
  was not always very disciplined on what I was checking into the repository.
  Often, courses would want us to submit files that were autogenerated, and so I
  checked in autogenerated files, binaries, images, csvs, etc. into the repository.
  Thus, I made an option in my scipt to ignore certain file extensions so
  that I do not get an inflated line count. Furthermore, I took the notion of "code"
  to mean anything that was not autogenerated, so I included file types like
   `.tex`, `.txt`, `.md` and `README` as code (as long as they were not autogenerated).

* **Prefer underestimates over overestimates.**
  I did not know how to use git freshman year, and as a result, I cannot get an
  accurate count for the number of lines of code for CS50, CS51, or CS179. As a result,
  I only included code that I entirely wrote myself, which excludes modifying code
  from distribution code from a problem set, and code I wrote as part of team projects.
  For CS51, I had the original
  tarball distribution for some of the assignments, so I was able to diff the distribution
  code with my final assignment submittion. As a result of this exlcusion, the line count
  for these three courses is much smaller than it actually is.

* **Only include code written for assignments.**
  As a result, I did not count lines of code written for section or lines of code
  I wrote when [TFing these past 3 years](http://kennyyu.me/blog/2014/04/29/reflecting-on-3-years-of-teaching/).

## Results

It's not a surprise for me that I have written more C code than any other language in college,
but it surprised me that python was a close second. However, I realized that I
now use python as my goto language for prototyping and data analysis, and I've used
python in more classes than any other class (CS283, CS181, CS109, both CS91r's, ES50, CS261)
compared to C (CS61, CS161, CS165). I was surprised the java count was so high,
as I have used java mainly in internships. I realized that this came from
CS124 (I used java for Mitzenmacher's programming assignments) and for CS262
(you gotta use java if you're in Jim Waldo's class!). Furthermore, I was shocked
that the ocaml (`.ml`) line count was so low, as I felt like I wrote much more code
when taking CS153 (Compilers). However, I haven't written ocaml code for a class since
compilers, and so this count makes sense.

I was a bit surprised at first on why the theoretical classes (CS124, CS121) had
such a high line count, and then I realized it was mostly due to `.tex` files.

CS161 is often considered the most difficult and time-consuming class at Harvard,
and so I thought that CS161 would probably have the highest line count. I was surprised
that CS181 and CS165 beat the CS161 count. I believe that because there was no
distribution code for CS165 (Data Systems), I had to write a lot more (but less interesting)
code to make all the glue for my database. For CS181, the course and assignments
were so disorganized the year I took it, and as a result, there were frequent large commits
that were mostly overhaul and rewriting everything.

When examining the line count by semester, my spring semesters have a much
higher line count than my fall semester, and my Spring 2013 semester has the
highest count (not a surprise! I was taking CS161 and CS181 at that time).

## Conclusion

In the end, I calculated that I made 197,717 changes
(141,008 insertions, 56,709 deletions) over the past four years. This number is
probably an underestimate, but I assume it's around the ballpark of the true number
of lines of code I've written in college. This makes me appreciate just how much
one can learn and do in four years!
