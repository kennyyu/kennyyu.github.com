In November 2012, I gave a seminar about [technical interviews](https://github.com/kennyyu/workshop)
for students in CS50.
I didn't realize that the video was on youtube until today, and it has almost 5000
views! I'm glad I can keep a memento of me teaching!

A note about the video: I usually use the whiteboard when teaching and I
write much neater than I do in the video. However, I had to use a tablet
for video recording purposes, and it's really hard to write on a touch screen!
